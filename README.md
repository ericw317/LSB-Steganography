# LSB-Steganography
This program will encode messages into images using LSB Steganography. This is a GUI-based program I created using the Flet framework for python, so if you want to build it on your own, you'll need to install that.
On the main screen you have an option to enter a key. This key will act as a seed in randomly selecting pixels to encode your message into. When you decode the message, you must use the same key that you encoded with.

If you want to download the executable directly, you can do so through sourceforge:
